This folder contains a makefile that will compile the main executable for
Calico and run a variety of examples (from the examples/ and martirank/
directories). The tool requires an ocaml and C compiler. It is known to
work correctly with ocamlc 3.12.1 and gcc 4.7.2.

Generated C files are stored in the examples/ folder, while generated
executables are stored in the top level directory. Both may be removed
by running the clean target.

Documentation and a writeup of the tool is in the documentation/ folder.
The martirank/ folder contains sources for the martirank application used
in experiments.
